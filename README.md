## Troubleshooting

### MySQL Connection Error
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3306
```
**Solution:** Ensure MySQL server is running
```bash
# Windows
net start MySQL80

# Mac
brew services start mysql

# Linux
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

### Database Not Found
```
Error: Unknown database 'powerbill_db'
```
**Solution:** Run the database setup script again
```bash
mysql -u root -p < database_setup.sql
```

### Server Not Starting
**Solution:** Check if port 3000 is already in use
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :3000
```
Change PORT in `.env` if needed.

### LocalStorage Full
The browser's localStorage can save ~5MB of data. For larger datasets, use the database instead.

## Sample Data

The database comes with sample bills:
- **PWR-001:** John Doe (Domestic) - ₹1,132.16
- **PWR-002:** Jane Smith (Commercial) - ₹4,200.00
- **PWR-003:** ABC Industries (Industrial) - ₹17,430.00

---

## Performance Tips

1. **For Large Datasets:**
   - Use database instead of localStorage
   - Implement pagination (already done)
   - Archive old bills regularly

2. **Browser Performance:**
   - Clear old LocalStorage data
   - Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

3. **Server Performance:**
   - Use database indexes (already optimized)
   - Implement caching for reports
   - Monitor query performance

## Security Considerations

- Validate all inputs on server
- Use HTTPS in production
- Sanitize database inputs
- Implement authentication for production
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Never commit `.env` file to version control

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication & authorization
- Payment gateway integration
- SMS/Email bill notifications
- Payment history & status tracking
- Consumption analytics & charts
- Multiple languages support
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Invoice customization
